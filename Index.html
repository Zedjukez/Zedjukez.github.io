    <h2>Aspiring Game Developer & Coder</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name is Ruben. 
    I am an aspiring game developer that loves to play lots of 
    games and occasionally draw at times. </p>

    <p>I always have lots of ideas in my head for projects I want to make and I'm very passionate about my work.<br>

        I love to work with others 
        and share my passion of gaming by making games myself and hopefully 
        <br>as I grow throughout my career make a game that many others can enjoy. </p>
